## What's a Rate?

A **rate** is a way of expressing how much of one thing (A) there is relative to a fixed amount of another thing (B) — teenagers per 1,000 people, vanity license plates per 100 cars, murders per 1,000 people, women per man, etc.

If the number of homicides in a city is 5 and the city's poulation is 100, then the homicide rate, or homicides per person, is 5/100, or 0.05. This means that for every person, there are 0.05 homicides. In other words, there are 0.05 murders per capita. Unless otherwise specified, a "rate" is "number of A per ONE of B."

But because a fraction of a homicide can be hard for some people to grasp, rates are often expressed not as "number of A per one of B" but "number of A per 1,000 B." For example, "Homicides per 1,000 people." To get this, it's as simple as multiplying the original rate by 1,000. So this homicide rate can also be expressed as "50 per 1,000 people."

A **percent** is just "number of A per 100 B" instead of "per 1 B" or "per 1,000 B." So you can say the homicide rate is 5%. It's the same as saying the homicide rate is "0.05" or "50 per 1,000."

To summarize, all of these sentences mean the same thing:

* The homicide rate is .05.
* The homicide rate is 5%.
* The homicide rate is 50 per 1,000.

There are many ways to express the same rate — and you need to decide which your readers will best understand based on the situation.

## Rate of Change

Say you have two values, A and B, and you want to see the percent change from A to B.

What you're looking for is a rate! You're asking, "How much change was there per one of A?"

So first you need the change:

`Change = B - A`

Then you need the change per A:

`RateOfChange = Change / A`

To be more concise, both of these steps can be combined like so:

`RateOfChange  = (B - A) / A`

This is a rate, like any other! Which means your PERCENT change is just the result of this times 100.

`PercentChange = ((B - A) / A) * 100`

What's weird about rate of change is that unlike other rates, it can be negative, because the CHANGE could be negative.

### Example ###

Let's say that the homicide count for one year was 100. For the next year, it was 150.

Change = 150 - 100 = **50**.

RateOfChange = 50 / 100 = **0.5**.

So the rate of change was 0.5, or 50%. In other words, for every homicide of the first year, there was 0.5 additional homicides the second year.
